# Boozang Docker Test runner container (XVFB + Puppeteer)

[`styrman/boozang`](https://hub.docker.com/r/styrman/boozang-runner/)

A [Boozang](https://boozang.com/) container, based on [nsourov/Puppeteer-with-xvfb](https://github.com/nsourov/Puppeteer-with-xvfb), to run Boozang tests in a browser with Xvfb.

## Description

This container executes a *Boozang* test (or test suite) defined by the provided *Boozang* test URL, in an [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) browser (via [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/)) using a virtual frame buffer (Xvfb).

It returns an error code if the test fails, and its report can be accessed thanks to a docker volume.

This container is mainly designed to be integrated to a *Continuous Integration* workflow.

### Requirement

Make sure to install Docker on your machine, and have a test created on the Boozang platform. Get the URL from the browser window by clicking the share icon or copy it from the browser window. You can also point to a test using the Alisas functionality under Settings.  

Get the authorization token (for non-public projects) on Boozang management (http://ai.boozang.com) -> Account -> Get Token.

## Usage

### Basic

The base command takes the **test URL** as a mandatory parameter:

`docker run --rm  -v "$(pwd):/var/boozang/" styrman/boozang-runner "https://ai.boozang.com/extension?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX5d35df3dd337ee52f36b113e#5d35df3dd337ee52f36b113e/0.0.1/m4/t3/"`

* `--rm` can be specified to remove the container after the test execution.
* `--shm-size 1G` should be specified to increase the memory available for the virtual browser

The command outputs the test steps and result to the console, and returns the following exit codes:

* 0 if the tests succeeded
* 1 if the tests failed
* 2 in case of any other error

### Options

The following options can be specified.

* `device`: define a specific [device](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/DeviceDescriptors.js) to run the tests
* `timeout`: define the command timeout time in seconds
* `token`: add a *Boozang* user token to the URL, to allow user connection. The token can also be directly specified in the URL. In this case, the environment variable token will be ignored.
* `file`: define the report and screenshot file name (without an extension). If not specified, the name is `boozang` followed by the date and time
* `screenshot`: if *true*, a screenshot is taken two seconds after opening the URL.

Example:

`docker run --rm  -v "$(pwd):/var/boozang/" styrman/boozang-runner --screenshot "https://ai.boozang.com/extension?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX5d35df3dd337ee52f36b113e#5d35df3dd337ee52f36b113e/0.0.1/m4/t3/"`


### Accessing reports

The report and screenshot are written to the container `/var/boozang` volume.

To retrieve them, the volume can be mapped to a local directory, this way:

`docker run --rm  -v "$(pwd):/var/boozang/" styrman/boozang-runner "https://ai.boozang.com/extension?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX5d35df3dd337ee52f36b113e#5d35df3dd337ee52f36b113e/0.0.1/m4/t3/"`
